# Global Warming Predicting Analysis

Goals and objectives:
To analyze various aspects that causes the global warming on earth and predict the disasters that might occur if this continues. The objectives of the project are listed below:

• Predicting the future temperatures of the earth.

• Effect of forest cover on temperature/rainfall/snow etc.

• Analyzing the melting of ice and its relation with the species getting endangered.

• Base on the data for past 20 years predicting the number of endangered species in future.
